# Ophthalmology domain-specific Neural Word Embeddings

- Word embddings which are specific to the domain of ophthalmology, trained on ophthalmology scientific literature abstracts from Pubmed 
- A set of analogies which are domain-specific to ophthalmology, which can be used to evaluate word embeddings on an ophthalmology-related task
